# SuperMarioBros.-World_2-1

## Description
This project was the first game I created using Unity. It was an assignment for my cross platform programming class during my first term at Toronto Film School's "Video Game Design and Development program". The project is a loose attempt to mimic World_2-1 of Super Mario Bros. for the NES. It was an assignment designed to learn the basics of the Unity game engine while also producing a playable level of a video game.
