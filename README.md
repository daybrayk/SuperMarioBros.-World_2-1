# SuperMarioBros.-World_2-1

## Description
This project was the first game I created using Unity. The project is a loose attempt to mimic World_2-1 of Super Mario Bros. for the NES. It was an assignment designed to learn the basics of the Unity game engine while also producing a playable level of a video game.

## Accomplishments
**Koopa:** I was able to successfully create a Koopa enemy that when landed on will duck into its shell. If left alone for a few seconds afterwards the Koopa will eventually come out of its shell and continue walking around. If the shell is jumped on again, before Koopa comes out, Koopa will die and the shell will become a projectile that flies around world and will kill the player.

**UI:** This project includes a full working UI that mimics that of the UI in the original game. The UI tracks the player's score, coins collected, Time, and Lives.

**Animations:** A fully working animation system is setup that allows Mario to Run, Jump, Die, Grow, Shrink, Shoot Fire, Reverse Direction, go invulnerable, and climb. All animations work as little Mario, big Mario, fire Mario, and invulnerable Mario.

**Game Manager:** The game is setup with a Game Manager system that keeps track of lives, time, and player score. It is also responsible for setting up the game scene, and transitioning between scenes so the game can be repeated as many times as possible without issue, and without having to leave the game.
